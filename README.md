Grab the Health Potion is a mobile game intended to be a 5 minute time waster with leaderboards.

In Grab the Health Potion, potion bottles fly across the screen and you have to try and tap them before they're gone. At the same time, you have to avoid grabbing other potions. You have 3 hearts as your life
bar. Missing a health potion is 1 damage. Hitting a non-health potion is also 1 damage.

Once your hearts are depleted, your total score is uploaded to the leaderboard and you are able to play again.
